# LKS D

My activity was started last Monday morning. I woke up at 3 a.m and **had done** my religion lesson in the school's web. 
I **will have finished** the religion lesson by the end of October, so that I can focus to the other school subjects.
I also **have finished** the civic lesson until 2nd chapter. Besides studying, I didn't fully do the school tasks, but also I help my mother clean the house. 
Since yesterday, I **had finished** swept and mopped the floor. I have to clean the house everyday, because there are some renovation that make my house got dirty. 
I hope the renovation **will have done** by the end of this month. My teacher **has told** all information about new lesson. This morning, I'm very exited
to do all activity, because I **had already** slept enough last night.
