1. The function of perfect forms is to indicate a completed, or "perfected," action or condition. Present perfect is used to show events or activities that have occurred at an unspecified time, while perfect is used to report activities or events that occurred before other activities occurred in the past.

2. I have ever used perfect forms in the sentence correctly. 

3. The pattern of the perfect forms is **Subject + have/has + past participle (V3)**. When it **past perfect**, the "have/has" can be change with **"had"**.
